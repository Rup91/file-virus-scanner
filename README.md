## File Virus Scanner - CLoud-Native Architecture

This repository contains two cloud-native architecture designs for implementing virus scanning in the file upload workflows:

1. âœ” Pre-Upload Virus Scanning
2. âœ” Post-Upload Virus Scanning

Both approaches use AWS services, serverless patterns, and antivirus integration such as ClamAV.

## âš  Security Considerations

âž¡ Files are scanned in-memory: no disk persistence.

âž¡ Lambda functions use minimal IAM roles

âž¡ Quarantined files are isolated with strict permissions

## ðŸŽ¯ Real-Life Applications

âž¡ Resume upload portals (HR tech)

âž¡ Document management systems

âž¡ Enterprise intranet portals

âž¡ Legal and healthcare file storage
